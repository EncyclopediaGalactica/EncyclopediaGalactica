\part{Mathematics}

GNC is applied mathematics. Once you accept this the life will be easier. Once
you made your life easier you can make the decision whether going into applied
mathematics or not. Going into applied mathematics means accepting the
friendship of mathematical rigour. I made this decision and accepted that
mathematics is good and will be part of my life, and I write this book
accordingly.

The mathematics chapter includes a landscape of what mathematics is needed for
GNC in a graph form which is an information retrieval thesaurus. This help you
to see what is the study material and when you feel lost helps you to find the
"You are here!" point on this map.

The interesting part in mathematics comes after calculus. Everything before it
is just dead boring. But, these boring things are the air in the clouds of
Calculus, so that, you have to know these things.
