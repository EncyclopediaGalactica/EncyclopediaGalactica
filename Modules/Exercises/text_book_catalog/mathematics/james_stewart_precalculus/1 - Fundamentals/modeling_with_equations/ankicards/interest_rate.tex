        The fee what is paid over the borrowed money is the \textbf{interest}.
        The most basic type of the \textbf{simple interest} meaning annual
        interest. The amount of loan called \textbf{principal}. The annual
        percentage paid for the use of the money is the \textbf{interest
        rate}.\\

        Where $I$ is the interest, $P$ is the principal amount, $r$ is the
        interest rate in percentage ($4\%$) and the $t$ is time, usually in
        years.
