= Structure

Structure describes the Document's structure.
Structure is a skeleton only.
It makes possible that the information (mainly text) and the input related rules can be attached to a structural element.
As it was described at the link:document-type.adoc#_description[Document entity] two types of information is stored in a Document: the information itself and information related to create (input) the information.
These entities in the system are separate entities from Structure, but Structure provides the skeleton.
The skeleton in this case is a graph (tree) where the Structure entity have nodes and the information can be attached to nodes.

We want to know the following details:

== Id

Every Structure Node has its own unique identifier.

== Parent

Every Structure Node knows who is its parent.

== Children

Every Structure Node knows who are its children.
