The goal of the Encyclopedia Galactica project is to provide a system where:

- documents can be uploaded
- document content can be managed in a versioned way
- connections between documents (a piece of document) and document content (e.g. a paragraph or sentence in the document) can be defined with a qualifier (extends, related, parent, child, etc)
- a rich user interface for editing and reading
- documents can be published
