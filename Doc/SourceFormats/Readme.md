# Encyclopedia Galactica
The goal of this application is being able to process high volume of information. The user should be able to 
create connections between piece of informations. The application should be able to help this.

In more technical details the above mission looks like the following:

- ability to load data into the system in any format (let's say with some limitations)
- ability to initiate search in the stored documents easily
- ability to create abstract information structures (tree, graph, thesaurus, taxonomy) and chain the piece of information to this
- the software should be able to offer categorisation and catalogisation based on provided metadata about the loaded doc
