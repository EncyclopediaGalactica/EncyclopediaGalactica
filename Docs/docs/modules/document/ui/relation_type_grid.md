## Listing Relation Types

- the grid has a single "Add" button to add a new Relation Type

## Creating a Relation Type

By clicking on the "Add" button the "Create" dialog comes up and:

- by filling the form the data content of a Relation Type entity can be defined

By clicking on the "Save" button the Relation Type entity will be saved, the dialog will be closed,
and the Relation Grid reloaded.

## Updating a Relation Type

To select which Relation Type entity will be edited the user has to click on the "Edit" button in the line
of the entity.

The opened "Edit" dialog makes possible to edit the details and save it by the "Save" button.
Once the "Save" button is clicked on the dialog closes and the Relation Type grid reloads.
